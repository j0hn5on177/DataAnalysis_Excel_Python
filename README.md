3 Projects I worked on during my time in the Thinkful Data Analytics Program:

1. Car-Rental Revenue Forecast Model in Excel

  Description: File contains raw inventory data for a car-rental company. Data includes car-ids, rental dates,     
  transactional revenues and costs , driver ages, genders, car models and manufacturers, branch information and other 
  calculations. All pivot table calculations, and data, are then incorporated into an interactive dashboard to provide 
  car revenues and branch revenues. 
  
  
2. House Prices A/B Hypotheses Testing in Excel 

  Description: File contains A/B hypothesis testing on a housing price dataset. Utilizes Excel's powerful Data Analysis   Toolpak to find statistical significance of certain variables and how much they influence house prices. These   hypothesis testing consists of the creation of confidence intervals and finding out p-value significance. 
  
  
3. Spotify Soundtrack Attributes A/B testing in Python
